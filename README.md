# Aiopulse

## Asynchronous library to control Rollease Acmeda Automate roller blinds

Requires Python 3 and uses asyncio.

### Installing
I plan on publishing this module to PiPy once I'm happy that it has been adequately tested.
For now, from the folder containing setup.py run `python setup.py install`.

### Demo.py commands:
